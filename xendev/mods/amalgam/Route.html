<h3 style="font-size:1.6rem;">No new strats have been found since the current RTA world records, however two things to note:</h3>

<h4 style="margin-left:3rem;margin-right:3rem;"> It is in theory possible to get the Water disposal voidclip route to work in Cutsceneless Any%. It was thought to be not worth it as you have to spend time aquiring the SMG nade, however, you can get it from the supply box at the start of Water disposal, in the room on front from the 2nd room of the level.</h4>
