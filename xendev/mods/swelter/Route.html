<h4 style="margin-left:3rem;margin-right:22rem;text-align:left;">There are two new strats in Deadtown. One is to skip the crank & bridge completely (seen in <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/Swelter/runs/zppql0vz">this IL run</a>) and second is a propclip route found by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ralle105">Rama</a>, see the image below.</h4>

<h4 style="margin-left:3rem;margin-right:22rem;text-align:left;">It is possible to BBT in the level Steppehills to skip the car completely as done in <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/Swelter/runs/m3kokewy">this IL run</a>, however the timesave is very minimal with semi-high risk as you have to do the rest of the level single segment due to the nature of BBT.</h4>
<h4 style="margin-left:3rem;margin-right:22rem;text-align:left;">It is possible to do another BBT in the level Commune to skip the final gate of the map as done in <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/Swelter/runs/z1k1kwgy">this IL run</a>. The BBT is surprisingly precise so if you go for it in a full-game run, be sure to practice it first.</h4>
<h4 style="margin-left:3rem;margin-right:22rem;text-align:left;">There is a huge skip in Airdrome by aquiring yesclip after the wake up cutscene by performing a few saveloads similarly to breenblast, this trick is called <a href="https://youtu.be/80cVXMlQJ6Q">roki blast</a> and was found by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ralle105">Rama</a>.</h4>
